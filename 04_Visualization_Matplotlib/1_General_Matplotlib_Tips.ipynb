    "We'll now take an in-depth look at the Matplotlib tool for visualization in Python. Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPYthon command line. IPython's creator, fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn't have time to review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set up on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003. It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib's developement and greatly expanded its capabilities."
