    "We have seen how principal component analysis can be used in the dimensionality reduction task - reducing the number of features of a dataset while maintaining the essential relationships between the points. While PCA is flexible, fast, and easyinterpretable, it does not perform so well when there are **nonlinear** relationships within the data; we will see some examples of these below."

    "To address this deficiency, we can turn to a class of methods known as **manifold learning** - a class of unsupervised estimators that seeks  to describe datasets as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces. When you think of a manifold, I'd sugest imaging a sheet of paper: this is a two-dimensional object that lives in our familiar three-dimensional world, and can be bent or rolled in two dimensions. In the parlance of manifld learning, we can think of this sheet as a two-dimensional manifold embedded in three-dimensional space."

    "Rotating, reorienting, or stretching the piece of paper in three-dimensional space doesn't change the flat geometry of the paper: such operations are akin to linear embeddings. If you bend, curl, or crumple the paper, it is still a two-dimensional manifold, but the embedding into the three-dimensional space is no longer linear. Manifold learning algorithms would seek to learn about fundamental two-dimensional nature of the paper, even as it is controted to fill the three-dimensional space."
