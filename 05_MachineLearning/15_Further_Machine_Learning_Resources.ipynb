As long as the chapter is, it is still too short to cover many interating and important algorithms, approaches, and discussions. Here I want to suggest some resources for those who would like to learn more about machine learning."

I assumes undergraduate-level understanding of mathematics and programming, and steps through detailed considerations of some of the most important machine learning algorithms. Homework assignments, which are algorithmically graded, have you actually implement some of these models yourself."
