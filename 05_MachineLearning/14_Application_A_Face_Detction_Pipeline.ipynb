    "This chapter has explored a number of the central concepts and algorithms of machine learning. But moving from these concepts to real-world applications can be a challenge. Real-world datasets are noisy and heterogeneous, may have missing features, and may include data in a form that is difficult to map to a clean `[n_samples'n_features]` matrix. Before applying any of the methods discussed here, you must first extract these features from your data; there is no formula for how to do this that applies across all domains, and thus this is where you as a data scientist must exercise your own intuition and expertise."

    "One interesting and compelling application of machine learning is to images, and we have already seen a few examples of this where pixel-level features are used for classifation. In the real world, data is rarely so uniform and simple pixels will not be suitable, a fact that has led to a large literature of **feature extraction** methods for image data."

We will use these features to develop a simple face detection pipeline, using machine learning algorithms and concepts we've seen throughout thsi chapter. We begin with the standard imports:"
