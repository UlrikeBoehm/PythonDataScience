Here we begin looking at several unsupervised estimators, which can highlight interesting aspects of the data without reference to any known labels."

    "In this section, we explore what is perhaps one of the most broadly used of unsupervised algorithms, principal component analsysis (PCA). PCA is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful as a tool for visualization, for noise filtering, for feature extraction and engneering, and much more. After a brief conceptual discussion of the PCA algorithm, we will see a couple examples of these further applications. We begin with the standard imports:"
