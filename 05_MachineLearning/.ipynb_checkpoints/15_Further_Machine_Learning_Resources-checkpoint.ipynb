    "This chapter has been a quick tour of machine learning in python, primarily using the tools within the Scikit-Learn library. As long as the chapter is, it is still too short to cover many interating and important algorithms, approaches, and discussions. Here I want to suggest some resources for those who would like to learn more about machine learning."
