    "The previous sections outline the fundamental isead of machine learning, but all of the examples assume that yiu have numerical data in a tidy, `[n_samples, n_features]` format. In the real world, data rarelt comes in such a form. With this in mind, one of the more importnant steps in using machine learning in practice is **feature engineering** - that is, taking whatever information you have about your problem ans turing it into numbers that you can use to build your feature matrix.\n",

Additionally, we will discuss **derived features** for increasing model complexity and **imputation** of missing data. Often this process is known as **vectorization**, as it involves converting arbitrary data into well-behaved vectors."
